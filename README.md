# cStatsExporter
Windows Docker Stats exporter for Prometheus.io. Compatible with cadvisor metrics !

Cadvisor is doing a very good job on linux while on windows there isn't anything.

It is exposing a subset of the cadvisor metrics depending on what is available on a windows host:

## Run with docker
```
docker run --rm -p 9030:9030  -v \\.\pipe\docker_engine:\\.\pipe\docker_engine alexvaut/cstatsexporter:latest
```
## Build the docker image
```
go build -o main.exe .
docker build -t cstatsexporter .
```
## Configuration
In config.yaml:
```yaml
scrapeIntervalSeconds: 5
port: 9030
```
All the configuration parameters can be setup through environment variables. For instance, for port, setup the environment variable PORT.


## Metrics:
Accessible from http://localhost:9030/metrics when publishing port 9030.
