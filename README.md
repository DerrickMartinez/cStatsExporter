# cStatsExporter
Windows Docker Stats exporter for Prometheus.io. compatible with Cadvisor metrics !

Cadvisor is doing a very good job on linux while on windows there isn't anything.

cStatsExporter is exposing Cadvisor metrics from windows containers depending on what the windows docker daemon makes available (the stats are not exactly the same between linux and windows).

cStatsExporter allows to reuse the same queries, grafana dashboards... that are working already with Cadvisor as a source. 

It's tested on Docker Desktop 2.1.3.0 on Windows 10 and docker EE 19.03.02 for windows server 2019.

## Run with docker
```
docker run --rm -p 9030:9030  -v \\.\pipe\docker_engine:\\.\pipe\docker_engine alexvaut/cstatsexporter:latest
```
## Run with docker-compose
```
services:
  cstatsexporter:
    image: alexvaut/cstatsexporter:latest
    volumes:
      - source: '\\.\pipe\docker_engine'
        target: '\\.\pipe\docker_engine'
        type: npipe    
```
## Deploy with docker-compose on a docker swarm cluster
```
services:
  cstatsexporter:
    image: alexvaut/cstatsexporter:latest
    volumes:
      - source: '\\.\pipe\docker_engine'
        target: '\\.\pipe\docker_engine'
        type: npipe
    deploy:
      mode: global
      placement:        
        constraints:
          - "node.platform.os == windows"              
```

## Build the docker image
```
go build -o main.exe .
docker build -t cstatsexporter .
```
## Configuration
In config.yaml:
```yaml
scrapeIntervalSeconds: 5
port: 9030
```
All the configuration parameters can be setup through environment variables. For instance, for port, setup the environment variable PORT.


## Metrics:
Accessible from http://localhost:9030/metrics when publishing port 9030.

```

## Metadata:

- node_meta can be used as a lookup to link a **node id** with its **node name** since each container deployed as a service in a docker swarm cluster has a label with its node id. The 3 labels are
  - node_name
  - node_id
  - container_label_com_docker_swarm_node_id
  
  The idea is from https://github.com/stefanprodan/swarmprom    
- host_meta an be used as a lookup to link a **container hostname** with its **node name**. The 2 labels are
  - node_name
  - host
  
  It's helpful when used in conjonction with telegraf(https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf) which is setting up a host label on each metric.
